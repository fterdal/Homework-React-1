# React Homework

[ðŸ“º Screencast Link](#youtube-link-goes-here)

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the tests: `npm test`
4. Run it locally: `npm start`

Your goal here is to make all the tests pass. The tests are organized in tiers.
You are advised to work through these tiers in order (`tests/tier-1` followed
by `tests/tier-2.js`, etc).

The only code you need to write is in the `src/components` folder. Please do not modify the tests except to make them run (e.g. `xit`, `it.only`, `describe.only`). Each tier has instructions and hints at the top. _Please read the hints carefully before beginning the tests._ They are there to help you!

You know what else is there to help you? The React Dev Tools!

- [Chrome Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Firefox Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

As you work through the tests, you are encouraged to view the running React
application in your browser, especially because you will be able to leverage the
awesome power of the React Dev Tools.

You can view the React application in the browser at
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## React Dev Tools Screencast

When you submit your work, you should also submit a short screen recording, no more than 2 minutes in length. You do not need to narrate anything, but you should open your React Dev Tools and show off the following features:

* Changing the state of a SinglePet (without clicking anything)
* Changing the props of PetList
* *Optional:* Anything else that you found useful!

## Learning Goals

- Rendering from props
- State
  - Setting state
  - Rendering from state
- Passing props to child components
- Lists and Keys
- Handling events: click, change
- GET data from a provided server
- DELETE data from a provided server
