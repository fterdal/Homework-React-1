# React Homework

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the tests: `npm test`
4. Run it locally: `npm start`

Your goal here is to make all the tests pass. The tests are organized in tiers.
You are advised to work through these tiers in order (`tests/tier-1` followed
by `tests/tier-2.js`, etc).

You may want to run a single test in isolation. To do so, replace `it` with
`it.only`. Just remember to change it back to `it` after you're done with that
test.

The React Dev Tools are your friend!

- [Chrome Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Firefox Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

As you work through the tests, you are encouraged to view the running React
application in your browser, especially because you will be able to leverage the
awesome power of the React Dev Tools.

You can view the React application in the browser at
[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
